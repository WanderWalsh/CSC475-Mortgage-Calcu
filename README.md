# CSC475-Mortgage-Calcu

This is the first project for my platform development class.

Assignment Requirements:
For this third Critical Thinking assignment, you will create a mortgage calculator app that allows the user to enter a purchase price, down-payment amount, and an interest rate.

1. Based on these values, the app should calculate the loan amount (purchase price minus down payment) and display the monthly payment for 10, 20, and 30-year loans.

2. Allow the user to select a custom loan duration (in years) by using a SeekBar and display the monthly payment for that custom loan duration.
